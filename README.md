Data are included via Github repo but if they dont work correctly, I have the CSV files so you can download the document locally and run it from desktop 

# Intro 

This report, written by Glenn Lauder and John Barrett, is focused on the interpretation and exploration of a Formula 1 Dataset with 14 CSV files (QPM, 2022). These have each been converted to Pandas DataFrames in order to use many of the Pandas methods for statistical analysis. The data in these DataFrames range from past and present drivers to constructor championship teams, including many of the most prestigious circuits on this planet.

This report aims to achieve and articulate the process of the exploration and understanding needed to learn about the statistics behind the sport, both in content and in methodology.

The First Section of this report is the most comprehensive, as we believe that it is crucial to gain a firm understanding of the dataset before approaching more specific variables for later analysis. This section uses a plethora of Python and Pandas methods to get an overview of the 14 DataFrames from a descriptive statistics and variable analysis perspective, which was helpful for dictating our path going into the later sections.

The Second Section focuses on correlation analysis, namely between the number of pitstops occurring in each lap. This was an area of interest which was discovered during our work in the First Section, highlighting the importance of the processes in descriptive statistics and variable analysis. Discussion on the conclusions of these outcomes has helped to gain a greater understanding of the meaning and potential of statistical analysis as a whole.

The Third Section builds up from the previous work on correlation analysis, working on building a Linear Regression Model that may allow prediction of data in these areas in the future. The accuracy (and inaccuracy) of this model as compared to the actual data can give insight into the potential improvements in methodology that could be implemented going forward.

Reporting on methods and outcomes has been written throughout this work, as to neatly and intuitively tie the graphical and numerical outcomes to their contextual and statistical meanings and interpretations.
